Tech Stack
Language: Go
Data Fetching: Stock Market API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Twelve Data)
Visualization: CLI (text-based) or a web framework like Gin for a browser-based UI
Storage (Optional): SQLite, MongoDB, or a CSV file for storing data.
For permanent storage I have used Sqlite3 which need to have install on your system.

This project covers APIs, CLI/web development, and real-time notifications. You can start small with a CLI-based tracker and expand it into a feature-rich web app!
